# financial-sentiment-analysis
Visit the [medium link](https://medium.com/@scheidlogan/financial-headline-sentiment-analysis-using-a-recurrent-neural-network-dabbfde08233) to see in depth detail on the specifics of this project. If you would like to clone this repository and run this jupyter notebook yourself, I have added a requirements.txt you can utlize to download the correct python packages necessary.
For these directions you will need python3 installed on your machine as well as some form of linux. If you would like to run this project in a different way as well, be my guest.

Run the following commands in your linux terminal:

Create the virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv <name_of_virtualenv>
```

Start the virtual environment:
```
source <name_of_virtualenv>/bin/activate
```

Download packages in requirement.txt (this may take a while depending on your machine):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Navigate to the root directory of the project on your machine and start the jupyter notebook.
